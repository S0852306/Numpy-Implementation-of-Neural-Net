# Numpy-Implementation-of-Neural-Net
Numpy implementation of Neural Networks with various solvers. 
Two-stage optimization is more suitable for high-precision 
nonlinear regression and surface fitting task.
# Compare With First-Order Stochastic Optimizer
"CompareWithTorch" provides a comparison between pure SGD-Based methods(Adam) and
the two-stage optimization strategy.
